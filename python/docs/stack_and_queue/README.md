No whiteboard for this challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Creates a stack and queue class with the node class.

Both stack and queue have methods to allow for adding to and removing from their lists in addition to being able to peek at the next value and check if the list is empty or not.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
1. Install requirements
1. Run `pytest -k test_stack.py` and `pytest -k test_queue.py`
