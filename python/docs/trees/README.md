# Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree Data Structures Implementations
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- `class BinaryTree`
  - `pre_order`
  - `in_order`
  - `post_order`
- `class BinarySearchTree`
  - `add`
  - `contains`

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
No whiteboard for this challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Creates binary tree and binary search tree classes with the a node class.

Binary tree has depth traversal methods for pre, in, and post order. Binary search tree has add and contains methods.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- [Binary Tree](../../data_structures/binary_tree.py)
- [Binary Search Tree](../../data_structures/binary_search_tree.py)

To test run `pytest -k binary` from the `~/python` directory.
