## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
No whiteboard for this challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Creates a linked list using two classes:

- LinkedList: instantiates an empty linked list
- Node: instantiates a node

Methods on the LinkedList class allow for insertion of a node at the head of the linked list and checking to see if a value is included in the linked list. The string method on the LinkedList returns a string representation of the linked list.
